    <h1>Why is this important?</h1>
    <p>Why should anyone study data structures and algorithms? For one thing, 
        it is at the core of computer programming. This website will cover 
        techniques every programmer should know. Additionally, this material is 
        usually the material that comes up during programming interviews.</p>
    <p>What is the connection between data structures and algorithms? Sedgewick 
        answers this question well, in his book on data structures and
        algorithms: </p>
    <blockquote>"...data structures exist as by products or end products of 
        algorithms, and thus we must study them to understand algorithms."
    </blockquote>
