    <h1>Primitives vs Data Structures vs ADTs</h1>
    <h2>Primitives</h2>
    <p>Primitives are the individual values the CPU manipulates. They typically 
        have a simply numeric representation:
        <br>
        <p class="bullet-l1">• int, float, double, bool, etc.</p>
        <br>
        Many have multiple variations; different sizes/precisions, signed-ness 
        and unsigned-ness, etc. Ultimately, all the data we manipulate with a 
        computer are composed of primitives.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
        Data structures are a technique for organizing a group of data within 
        the computer's memory - i.e. how the data are physically structured/
        laid-out in memory. When using object oriented programming, objects are 
        created to organize the data invovled in the computation of an
        algorithm.
        <br>
        Some examples include:
        <p class="bullet-l1">• Arrays</p>
        <p class="bullet-l1">• Records (C/C++ struct/union)</p>
        <p class="bullet-l1">• Linked Structures</p>
            <p class="bullet-l2">◦ Linked lists (AKA chains)</p>
            <p class="bullet-l2">◦ Trees and graphs</p>
        <p class="bullet-l1">• (simple) hash table</p>
