# Why is this material important?

Why should anyone study data structures and algorithms? For one thing, this material is at the core of computer programming. As Sedgewick once said:

> ...data structures exist as by products of algorithms, and thus we must study them to understand algorithms.

Additionally, this material is the material that appears on technical interviews. These pages will cover algorithms every programmer should know. It will cover algorithms and techniques you can use to adapt existing algorithms and formulate new ones tailored to a specific purpose.
